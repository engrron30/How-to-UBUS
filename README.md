# How-to-UBUS

This repository aims to run and test UBUSD using Ubuntu Linux. ubus is typically executed in OpenWRT-based and this repo can serve as guide to simulate or experiment ubus in Linux-based terminal.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Prepare Environment

### 1. Prepare dependencies.

Using __apt__, update and install the necessary dependencies in your machine.

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y build-essential git libjson-c-dev libblobmsg-json-dev pkg-config

__[RECOMMENDED]__ Instead of manually pasting these commands on your terminal, you may use the shell script in this repo:

    ./Scripts/01_install-dependencies.sh

### 2. Prepare libubox and ubus code.

The _libubox_ and _ubus_ code are the vital part of the code to run ubusd. Their codebase can be collected in checking OpenWRT links by doing the following commands:
    
    git clone https://git.openwrt.org/project/libubox.git
    git clone https://git.openwrt.org/project/ubus.git

The cloning step can be done by manually running the script file below:

    ./Scripts/02_clone-repos.sh

__[RECOMMENDED]__ Fortunately, you do not have to do the steps above. After you clone this repo, the _libubox_ and _ubus_ code are already added in Packages directory.

### 3. Prepare your service code.

In the _Source_ directory, the _main.c_ file serves as the main program for hello service. This hello service intends to be registered in the ubus daemon, so that later, it can be called when someone triggers it in ubus. This service just prints hello as its message attribute value when triggered.

A simple hello service in C could be the following:

    #include <libubus.h>
    #include <libubox/blobmsg_json.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    static struct ubus_context *ctx;

    // Handler for the "say" method
    static int hello_handler(struct ubus_context *ctx, struct ubus_object *obj,
                             struct ubus_request_data *req, const char *method,
                             struct blob_attr *msg) {
        struct blob_buf b = {};
        blob_buf_init(&b, 0);
        blobmsg_add_string(&b, "message", "Hello from ubus!");
        ubus_send_reply(ctx, req, b.head);
        blob_buf_free(&b);
        return 0;
    }
    
    static const struct ubus_method hello_methods[] = {
        UBUS_METHOD_NOARG("say", hello_handler),
    };
    
    static struct ubus_object_type hello_type =
        UBUS_OBJECT_TYPE("hello_type", hello_methods);

    static struct ubus_object hello_object = {
        .name = "hello",
        .type = &hello_type,
        .methods = hello_methods,
        .n_methods = ARRAY_SIZE(hello_methods),
    };

    int main() {
        ctx = ubus_connect(NULL);
        if (!ctx) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Failed to connect to ubusd\n");
            return 1;
        }

        if (ubus_add_object(ctx, &hello_object)) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Failed to add ubus object\n");
            ubus_free(ctx);
            return 1;
        }

        printf("UBUS 'hello' object registered. Waiting for calls...\n");
        ubus_add_uloop(ctx);
        uloop_init();
        uloop_run();

        ubus_free(ctx);
        return 0;
    }

### 4. Build the Packages and Source

There are two main directories to compile in this repo: (a) _Packages_ and (b) _Source_. 

_Packages_ contain the needed OpenWRT-based code to run ubusd. To build the packages, go to _Packages_ directory then do _make_ command.

_Source_ is where our service code is located. To build the packages, go to _Source_ directory then do _make_ command. So, if you want to add your own service, add or modify file in _Source_ directory.

What happens when you do make in Source are the following commands but you do not need to manually type these because it is aready handled by Makefile for abstraction.
    
    gcc -o hello_service main.c \
        -I../libubox -I../ubus -I../Include \
        -L../libubox/build -lubox -lblobmsg_json \
        -L../ubus/build -lubus

__[RECOMMENDED]__ You can skip the above step for simplicity. Just do _make_ in the top directory and both Packages and Source are compiled.

To remove the compiled file, just do:

    make clean

### 5. Run ubusd.

The compiled _ubusd_, _ubus_ and _hello_service_ are copied to the _Scripts_ directory if build is successful. Go to this directory and run the following:
    
    sudo ./ubusd -s "my_own_socket.sock" &

__[ALTERNATIVE]__ Or simply run the _03_run-ubusd.sh_ in Scripts folder.

### 6. Register hello service in ubus.

Register the hello service and its object and method in ubus by running the following service code:
    
    sudo ./Scripts/hello_service &

If hello service is successfully registered in ubus, you should see your hello_service running in ubus waiting to be called. Verify if it is listed in ubus by doing the following command:

    sudo ./Scripts/ubus list

### 7. Trigger hello from ubus.
    
    sudo ./Scripts/ubus call hello say

## üõ†Ô∏è Structure of Service Code in UBUS

Your service code is what we would like to register in the ubus daemon. To create one, your code should contain the following:

### Includes

This is needed to find our libubox and ubus code in the Packages. _stdio_ is also included as default.

    #include <libubus.h>
    #include <libubox/blobmsg_json.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

### Define your hello service handler. 

What we would like to do is to add a _message_ attribute with value "Hello from ubus!" in this _hello_handler_ function. You may add other attributes but in this case, we make it simple.

    static struct ubus_context *ctx;

    static int hello_handler(struct ubus_context *ctx, struct ubus_object *obj,
                             struct ubus_request_data *req, const char *method,
                             struct blob_attr *msg) {
        struct blob_buf b = {};
        blob_buf_init(&b, 0);
        blobmsg_add_string(&b, "message", "Hello from ubus!");
        ubus_send_reply(ctx, req, b.head);
        blob_buf_free(&b);
        return 0;
    }

### Define your hello service method.

What we added previously is the handler. This time, we specify which method is going to trigger the previous handler. If the ubus command uses the _say_ method, the handler above is going to be executed. You may add other ubus methods here by appending it to the array below.

    static const struct ubus_method hello_methods[] = {
        UBUS_METHOD_NOARG("say", hello_handler),
    };

### Define the hello service type.

What we added previously is the method. This time, we specify which type is our hello service. In this part, we link the hello_type to use hello_methods array as its ubus methods.

    static struct ubus_object_type hello_type =
        UBUS_OBJECT_TYPE("hello_type", hello_methods);

### Define the hello service object

The hello service is going to be abstracted as a whole object. This object requires the method and type we set earlier. In this case, the following code suffices to add hello object:

    static struct ubus_object hello_object = {
        .name = "hello",
        .type = &hello_type,
        .methods = hello_methods,
        .n_methods = ARRAY_SIZE(hello_methods),
    };
